SuperTiled2Unity Documentation
============================================

SuperTiled2Unity is a collection of Unity scripts that import files from the popular `Tiled Map Editor <https://www.mapeditor.org/>`_ in your Unity projects.

The goal of SuperTiled2Unity is that **it just works**. Except for the most specialized cases users should be able to quickly and easily add tile-based 2D content to their Unity projects.

SuperTiled2Unity is currently distibuted as a Unity Package at any price you choose (including free).
Additional `donations can be made <http://www.seanba.com/donate>`_ and are always appreciated.
