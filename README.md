About SuperTiled2Unity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SuperTiled2Unity is a Unity Package that gives you the ability to import your [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) maps directly into your Unity projects.

SuperTiled2Unity uses [Scripted Importers](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptedImporters.html), available with Unity 2018 and later, so that the import process is contained completely within your Unity project across all platforms. Updates are made automatically as you make changes to your map in Tiled and save them. There's no need for a separate export process.
